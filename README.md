# Instructions

Open index.html file in a browser.  
Your code will live in the index.js file. Some variables still writen can help you.

1. Make the duck move with keyboard with the stepX or stepY increment.  
When the duck moves, the duck element has only one class name.  
.duck-down, .duck-right, .duck-up or duck-left depending on its direction

2. Prevent the duck from going out of the screen

3. Call the shoot function (already implemented) when duck is shot

4. Manage the Game Over Case by using bulletCount variable. A sound gunshot.mp3 can be played to have more realistic effect.
